1) read in the raw output file
2) create a blank summary report file
3) generate summary statistics for loci
	concatenate all species genotypes together (Columns 4-13) to create a locus genotype
	count the frequency of each unique locus genotype
4) write loci summary statistics to the summary file
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
summary report of <raw output file name here>
generated <todays date and time>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	X loci examined
	X species examined: (this is equal to the number of columns in the dataset minus 3, divided by two)
		list species 
	monomorphic for all species = + for all species
	unique to reference species = + for only one species
	of the remaining loci,
	X loci are missing data from one species (the number of genotypes that contain only one N)
	X loci are missing data from two species (the number of genotypes that contain two Ns)
	X loci are missing data from three species (the number of genotypes that contain three Ns)
	X loci are missing data from four species (the number of genotypes that contain four Ns)
	X loci are missing data from five or more species (the number of genotypes that contain five or more Ns)
4) generate summary statistics for each species
	each species' data is listed in its own column (Columns 4-13 in the raw output file)
		a = count the number of +'s in each column
		b = count the number of -'s in each column
		c = count the number of N's in each column
		d = number of rows
		e = average # of successful genotypes (a+b)/d
5) append summary statistics for each species to the summary file in the following format
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
species name
		number of loci examined = <d>
		Genotypes successfully determined for <e> percent of loci
		Presence of TE detected for <a> loci
		Absence of TE detected for <b> loci
		Genotype could not be determined for <c> loci
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### eventually it would be nice to write this thing in such a way that it can find the
