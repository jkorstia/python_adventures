Since I will probably be running the program multiple times and we need practice, lets set up arguments
-i, --input, the input file (which is the output file from the "n-way" tool)
-o, --output, the name of the output file to be created

1) read in the raw output file
2) create a blank summary report file
3) generate summary statistics for loci
	full list of desired stats below in the sample of the summary output
4) write loci summary statistics to the summary file in a format similar to this example below
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
summary report of <raw output file name here>
generated <todays date and time>

	X loci examined
	X species examined: (this is equal to the number of columns in the dataset minus 3, divided by two)
		list of species 
	monomorphic for all species = (+ for all species)
	unique to reference species = (+ for only one species)
	of the remaining loci, (the ones that are NOT monomorphic or unique to the reference species)
	X loci are missing data from one species (the number of genotypes that contain only one N)
	X loci are missing data from two species (the number of genotypes that contain two Ns)
	X loci are missing data from three species (the number of genotypes that contain three Ns)
	X loci are missing data from four species (the number of genotypes that contain four Ns)
	X loci are missing data from five or more species (the number of genotypes that contain five or more Ns)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) write a loop or function that will generate summary statistics for each species
	each species' data is listed in its own column (Columns 4-13 in the raw output file)
		a = count the number of +'s in each column
		b = count the number of -'s in each column
		c = count the number of N's in each column
		d = number of rows
		e = average # of successful genotypes (a+b)/d
5) append summary statistics for each species to the summary file in the following format
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
species name
		number of loci examined = <d>
		Genotypes successfully determined for <e> percent of loci
		Presence of TE detected for <a> loci
		Absence of TE detected for <b> loci
		Genotype could not be determined for <c> loci
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
